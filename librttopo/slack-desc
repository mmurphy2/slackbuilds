# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

librttopo: librttopo (RT Topology Library)
librttopo:
librttopo: The RT Topology Library exposes an API to create and manage standard
librttopo: (ISO 13249 aka SQL/MM) topologies using user-provided data stores. The
librttopo: code is derived from the PostGIS liblwgeom library enhanced to provide
librttopo: thread safety, have fewer dependencies, and be independent from
librttopo: PostGIS release cycles.
