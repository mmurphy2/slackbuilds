# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ocproxy: ocproxy (user-level SOCKS and port-forwarding proxy for openconnect)
ocproxy:
ocproxy: ocproxy is a user-level SOCKS and port forwarding proxy for
ocproxy: OpenConnect based on lwIP. When using ocproxy, OpenConnect only
ocproxy: handles network activity that the user specifically asks to proxy, so
ocproxy: the VPN interface no longer "hijacks" all network traffic on the host.
ocproxy:
ocproxy: OpenConnect can (and should) be run as a non-root user when using
ocproxy: ocproxy.
